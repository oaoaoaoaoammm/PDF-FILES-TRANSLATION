## PDF FILES TRANSLATION
Since I have been working with China, I need to translate text in pdf files, on drawings, without affecting other elements and their shifts

## How to use?
1. download [```main.py```](https://github.com/oaoaoaoaoammm/PDF-FILES-TRANSLATION/blob/main/main.py) and [```requirements.txt```](https://github.com/oaoaoaoaoammm/PDF-FILES-TRANSLATION/blob/main/requirements.txt)
2. ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in terminal where u saved files from 1.
3. then edit [```main.py```](https://github.com/oaoaoaoaoammm/PDF-FILES-TRANSLATION/blob/main/main.py):
   
You can [add](https://github.com/oaoaoaoaoammm/PDF-FILES-TRANSLATION/blob/1f67cbc7f3ad6d599ac4f941c4aca0c6199f64a9/main.py#L76) folder or [change](https://github.com/oaoaoaoaoammm/PDF-FILES-TRANSLATION/blob/1f67cbc7f3ad6d599ac4f941c4aca0c6199f64a9/main.py#L76)(i just add in same directory, because in ./pdf_files **will be created** directory _translated_pdfs_)

[```translate_pdf_files_in_folder(folder_path, dest_language="en")```](https://github.com/oaoaoaoaoammm/PDF-FILES-TRANSLATION/blob/1f67cbc7f3ad6d599ac4f941c4aca0c6199f64a9/main.py#L77) change ```dest_language``` to any which you need.

4. enjoy


**Don't use this translated PDFs as main because somewhere it can be incorrect because of white painting(i have no idea how to change it, so i added comments for fabrics that it may has errors)**
